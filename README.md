# Get Playstation Deals

This is a small python script to get best deals from playstation store. 
Checking against weekly deals and PSN free games & discounts

### QuickStart
`pip install https://github.com/kireevco/psndeals.git@master`
`psndeals show`

### TODO:
- PSN authentication is currently broken. Don't even look into a mess in `auth.py` (unless you would like to send a PR:) 
- Automatically purchase free PSNPLUS games
